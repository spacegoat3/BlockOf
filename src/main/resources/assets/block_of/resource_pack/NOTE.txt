[WHAT IS THIS?]
This folder contains a different version of textures that has no lines.
Those lines in original textures represents tapes or ropes. but because some people may
not like this addition, I decided to make a Resource Pack with different textures.

[CAN I MAKE THIS MYSELF?]
If you want to make a Resource Pack for the mod yourself, you can do and post it. I
will be glad.

[CAN I USE THOSE TEXTURES?]
You can use this textures in every way you want, but please credit me if you are going
to use them in a public project.

Have fun :)
